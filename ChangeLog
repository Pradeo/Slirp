Version 1.0.16 RELEASE Sept 7, 2004 (RWP)
From 1.0.14pre1
- Changes for operation under Cygwin
- Added patch for Cygwin I_PUSH by Michael Wetherell
- dns is now transferred to peer, (If compiled with -DUSE_MS_DNS)
  (Ripped off from hacked pppd version 2.2.0f)
- Two dns options can be specified on command line, (Only the first
  is used internally, but both will get transferred to peer)
- Has a hack for connecting to a MS direct cable connect (If compiled
  with -DMS_DCC) Only works when PPP (-P option) is chosen, but gives
  effectively a nat'ed direct cable connect. (A chat script option would
  be nicer)
- Fix to exit code that incorrectly iterated list of tty's attached
- Fixes to terminal restore code, No longer closes stdin on exit
- If stdout, or stderr are redirected, it wont close them
  (so you can debug using fprintf(stderr...)
- No longer removes 0's, 1's from incoming data stream
- New Option nozeros to not look at strings of 0's, 1's to cause
  exit/suspend (See docs/CONFIG)
- Can specify alternate tty on command line using "tty ttydevice"
  (Overrides SLIRP_TTY environment variable) (see docs/CONFIG)
- Debug builds log raw incoming data, and ppp checksum fault packets
- Minor documentation updates
- Does not close all file handles, (Pain when trying to debug)
- Can manually turn on early debugging in main()
- Most of Tims security fixes in place, (It is still insecure...)
  Probably snprintf will make slirp less portable.
  (Sorry Tim, I don't like strncpy, so replaced them with a strncpy2)

Version 1.0.13 RELEASE Sept 30, 2000 <Kelly>
- Added a patch posted on SourceForge to use any arbitrary tty as a port
  instead of the console.
- Fixed above patch to restore normal functionality by making the tty
  /dev/tty
- Fixed the above fix by saving and restoring the tty state.

* Anyone know about Secure sockets?

Version 1.0.12 RELEASE August 30, 2000 <Kelly>
- Fixed my patch to sync with Debian's version of Slirp.
- Promised again not to "pull a Linus" -- aka releasing it and not
  testing it to make sure it was good. :P
- Added ShengHuo ZHU's patches.  RSH emulation added.  Solaris 2.x 
  should work in compiling.

Version 1.0.11 RELEASE August 20, 2000 <Kelly>
- Added a patch to sync with Debian's version of Slirp.
- Fixed a typo with README.NEXT

Version 1.0.10 RELASE May 27, 2000 <Kelly>
- Moved the whole mess to SourceForge.  The URL is slirp.sourceforge.net now.
  Updated docs.

Version 1.0.9 RELEASE Feb 22, 2000 <Kelly>
- Added some #ifdefs to fix bad compilation on Solaris i86 boxes.
  May also fix a few things with others.  We'll find out soon.
- Rearranged documentation
- Added some warnings to the configure.in script about not using GCC for
  compiling anything.  Seriously, folks, why don't you have GCC on your
  system?  I've compiled it myself, and it's too eazy not to mess up.
- Version numbering changed to be more Linux Kernelish.

Version 1.0.8 (aka 1.0h) RELEASE (22/10/1999) <Kelly>
- Switched from commenting out to the much saner #ifdefs. 
- Edited some of the documentation to point to new maintainer (me)

Version 1.0g-dk1 BETA (18/10/99)
- Merged in logwtmp, tcp connection closing fixes from "Slirp 1.0c-KK".
  Slirp compiles once again on Linux boxen.

Version 1.0g RELEASE (13/08/99)
- Cleanup of the ICMP code.  No ICMP packets are generated on receipt of an
  ICMP packet with an error, except if the type is {0,8,[13-18]}.  See RFC 1122.
- Local host  ping -f  crash solved.

Version 1.0f RELEASE (19/01/99)
- UDP sorecvfrom(so) code: the timeout for domain name lookup (port 53)
  is not reset if recvfrom() returns an error.  Zero size UDP packets are
  forwarded.

Version 1.0e RELEASE (05/12/98)
- Corrected a bug in the udp sorecvfrom(so) code.  UDP packets were sent with 
  udp_output() to the client even if the packet was received with an 
  error.  ICMP packets are generated in this case.
- Debugged the EMU_CMD handling in tcp_input().  A telnet to the config
  port, default 10.0.2.0, could not be closed from the client side (only
  by typing quit at the prompt).  The connection remained open and 
  re-telnetting gave the message "Already connected".  The tcp finite state 
  machine went into the CLOSE WAIT state and waited forever for the 
  non-existing remote socket to close. 
  Solution : If a FIN is received and the socket is EMU_CTL, then the fsm goes 
  directly to the LAST ACK state and sends an ACK + FIN (one packet).

Version 1.0d RELEASE (19/8/98)
- Fixed core dumping while reassembling ip packets
  found a bug in      ip.h, ipasfrag.ipf_mff
  found an error in   mbuf.c, dtom()
- Added limited ICMP support.  ICMP packets are generated when
  a bad IP packet is received (full support)
  an ICMP packet can not be imitated as a UDP packet sent to port 7
  a UDP packet can not be sent, "Network is unreachable"
  a UDP packet is received with an error, usually "Port unreachable"
  a TCP connection can not be made, "Network is unreachable"
  <vdb128@tele.kotnet.org>

Version 1.0c RELEASE (15/1/96)

- Fixed a problem with chmod()ing Slirp's tty.
- Fixed a problem with --disable-ppp.
- Added the ability to have ranges in the "escape" command.  So, for
  example, now you can use the command "escape 0-1f,ff" instead of
  "escape 0,1,2,3,...,1f,ff".
- Added patches for HPUX for slirp.ftpd thanks to Jeff Thieleke
  <thieleke@icaen.uiowa.edu>.  It's in slirp.ftpd-b.tar.gz in the "extra"
  directory at the usual Slirp ftp sites.
- Added an updates man page, thanks to George Ferguson
  <ferguson@cs.rochester.edu>.  It's in src/slirp.man.

Version 1.0b RELEASE (4/1/96)

- Fixed a few minor problems with compilation on some hosts.
- Added a few more FAQs to the documentation (slirp.doc).
- Fixed for systems without FIONBIO.
- Fixed a small bug in add emu, thanks to gentile@netcom.com.
- Changed the default baudrate to 115200.
- Added the option "keepalive" and "keepalive S" which enables TCP
  keep-alives.  This makes Slirp probe each TCP connection every minute or
  so, or if given an argument, every S seconds.
- When load-balancing over multiple modems, you can now specify the password
  in the environmental variable SLIRP_PASSWORD, then give Slirp the
  arguements "-l x,host:port,-".  This is for systems where the password is
  still seen in a "ps x" even though Slirp tries to hide it, like Solaris.
- Add some performance enhancments to the load-balancing code, which
  includes the addition of the "towrite_max N" option, and updated the
  documentation accordingly.
- Fixed for systems without fchmod().
- Added the option "ppp_exit" which will force Slirp to exit when PPP goes
  down.  This way, if you type "exec slirp" from your shell prompt, when you
  kill your PPP software you will be logged out.

Version 1.0a RELEASE (25/12/95)

- Finally released version 1.0.  Yipee!  Please read the section "Thanks" in
  the file slirp.doc for a list of people I want to thank.
- Revamped the documentation.  All the README.* files have been removed and
  put into slirp.doc, with many other additions.  Please read it.
- Turned on Talk emulation by default.  What the heck, why not?
- Added IDENT emulation.  Now incoming connections can be properly
  identified if your software uses the IDENT protocol.  Thanks to TheGit for
  his help with this.  Note: this is not complete yet.  You can send
  queries, but the reply, while correct, won't be the right format for most
  programs.
- Added emulation for RealAudio 2.0 thanks to Juha Pirkola.
- Added the ability to load-balance over multiple hosts/accounts.
- Fixed detection of SIGHUP on a unit other than 0.
- Fixed a bug in fork_exec, thanks to Theodore Hope
  <hope@ChanChan.pnic.pnud.org.pe>.
- Lots of other minor fixes.

Version 0.95j BETA (19/11/95)

- Fixed a problem with --disable-ppp, thanks to Lynn Larrow
  <llarrow@netcom.com>.
- Ooops!  Forgot to uncomment a peice of code used in rlogin emulation.
  Rlogin should work properly now.
- Added emulation for "ping".  Pinging the remote host will work properly
  all the time (if slirp is actually working), but pinging other hosts may
  not work even if the host is up.  This is because slirp uses UDP to
  "emulate" ping, not real ICMP ECHO-REQUEST packets which ping uses.
- Lots of minor fixes thanks to Juha Pirkola.

Version 0.95i BETA (16/11/95)

- "Fixed" a problem with WNOHANG not being defined on OSF/1 systems,
  although it's not really fixed, thanks to Jeff Skone
  <jeffs@u.washington.edu>.
- Fixed a redefinition error when net/if.h was #included, thanks to gruppo
  progetto -cds <progetto@ds.cised.unina.it>.
- Fixed compilation on NeXT systems, thanks to Tomas Hurka
  <tom@hukatronic.cz>.
- Made chap and upap files ~/.chap-secrets and ~/.pap-secrets respectivaly.
- Fixed a problem with sending a window of 0 on a SYN-ACK packet, which
  would cause problems with some TCP/IP stacks with certain programs (eg:
  Trumpet Winsock and mIRC)  Thanks to Bjorn Eng <Bjorn.T.Eng@jpl.nasa.gov>
  for helping me find this problem.
- Updated to ppp-2.2-RELEASE PPP code.
- Added preliminary patches for better load-balancing support when the
  modems are not connected at the same speed.  These will be finished when I
  am able to get access to a second modem/ph. line.  #define FULL_BOLT in
  config.h if you wish to test it.
- Added support for rlogin. (rsh and rexec may come soon)
- Hopefully fixed the small-packet-syndrome once and for all!
- Lots of other minor fixes.

I hope this will be the last release before version 1.0.

Version 0.95h BETA (10/9/95)

- Fixed a rather nasty memory leak when BSD-compression was used.  Thanks to
  Valtteri Vuorikoski <vuori@sci.fi> for pointing it out, and Blake "Wacko"
  Wright for helping me fix it (again).
- Fixed another rather nasty bug where urgent data could kill the
  connection.  Thanks to Blake "spam me!" Wright for helping me fix it.
- Fixed a third rather nasty bug which would corrupt uploads in certain
  situations (usually uploading large files).  Thanks again to Blake "woody"
  Wright for helping find the problem.
- Fixed the "password" option when placed in the ~/.slirprc file.
- Fixed ./configure to recognise Unix sockets, thanks to Chris Metcalf.
- Maybe fixed a PPP problem, thanks to Steve Kneizys
  <stevo@acad.ursinus.edu>.

Version 0.95g ***BETA*** (26/8/95)

- Fixed the baudrate bug in 0.95f.
- Added a few more Motorola fixes.

PLEASE NOTE: This is still *BETA* software.  If you don't *need* to upgrade,
*don't*!  It *will* fail.  Infact, I guarantee there are bugs in 0.95g.  I
know, I put them there! :)  If you rely on slirp for your Internet
connectivitiy, *wait* for a stable version.  The most stable version so far
is 0.9p (but it does lack a lot of features in the 0.95x releases).

Version 0.95f BETA (24/8/95)

- Fixed ./configure wrt unix-domain sockets.
- Fixed DCC CHAT wrt mIRC (and possibly others) (thanks to Shawn Hecker
  <heckers@freenet2.scri.fsu.edu> for finding this problem).
- "add emu" will now mark allready-connected sockets to be emulated.
- Added a password to telnet 10.0.2.0.  See the "password" option to set the
  password. (before entering any commands, you must enter "pass PASSWORD").
- Hopefully fixed OOB data ("Urgent data").
- Fixed a bug in if_input (thanks to Robert Smathers <roberts@nmia.com> for
  helping find the problem).
- Fixed a bug in main_loop() which should fix the problem with SCO's.
  (thanks to  "Jamie C. Hellstrom" <silkmare@baste.magibox.net> for helping
  find this problem)
- Fixed an error with the baudrate calculation.  Telnet should be more
  responsive now. (Thanks to Antti Toivonen <atoivone@snakemail.hut.fi> for
  pointing this out).
- Cleaned up a few things so it'll compile on more systems.
- Fixed BSD compression to work with VJ compression, thanks to Juha Pirkola.
- Made 2 fixes to get it to compile on Motorola SVR4, thanks to Mark Scott
  <mscott@quaver.urbana.mcd.mot.com>.
- Fixed load-balancing on SunOS.
- A few other changes and fixes.

Version 0.95e BETA (2/8/95)

- Fixed compression autodetection in SLIP.
- Put the "compress" command back in.  Please, do NOT use it unless slirp
  does not autodetect CSLIP for you (shouldn't happen... anymore :)
- Fixed a stupid mistake I made for talk emulation.
- Made slirp compile on systems without unix-domain sockets.  However,
  without unix-domain sockets, you will not be able to restart nor use
  load-balancing.
- Added more spellink paches from Chris Metcalf.

Version 0.95d BETA (27/7/95)

- Added more patches from Chris Metcalf, including OSF/1 patches.  It should
  work on OSF/1 with gcc now.
- Fixed a bug WRT multiple modems.  You'd only be affected if your modems
  are not all the same speed.  This may also improve single-modem
  performance, but I doubt it :)
- Added talk/ytalk emulation thanks to Juha Pirkola.
  Note: it will only work for *outgoing* requests.  Also, you need to enable
  it by editing config.h and defining EMULATE_TALK, since a rogue user *may*
  make slirp malloc() too much data.
- Added emulation for RealAudio and CuSeeMe, thanks (again :) to Juha
  Pirkola.
- Added the client program "supload" which acts a little like "tupload" in
  term.  Read the file README.supload in the client/supload directory for
  instructions.
- Fixed some configuration stuff, including mtu/mru to be recognised when
  PPP is not compiled into slirp.
- Fixed a bug in (surprise!) SunOS, which would not terminate slirp upon
  loss of carrier.
- Other stuff.

Version 0.95c BETA (22/7/95)

- Added patches for 64-bit systems from Chris Metcalf.
- Made "redir" more flexible.  Now you can use a service name instead of
  port to redirect to, and the (host's) port may be omitted, in which case a
  0 is assumed.  For example "redir ftp" is the same as the old
  "redir 0 21".  You can also use the service name with "add exec", eg:
  "add exec nntpd:nntp".

Version 0.95b BETA (21/7/95)

- Added the command "wait" from Chris Metcalf, among other fixes
  (including a fatal SunOS bug... surprise, surprise)
- Added patches from Wilson Cheung for BSDI.
- Fixed the Slirp> prompt.
- A few other things, I forget.

Version 0.95a BETA (19/7/95)

- Finished the load-balancing support as started in 0.9n.  Read the file
  README.load-balancing for instructions on how to use it.  Big thanks goes
  to Blake Wright bmwright@xmission.com for his patience in testing the
  code, since I only have one modem.
  As a result of the load-balancing support, the restart code has been
  "generalised", and changed.  Please read the file README.restart to see
  how it has changed.
- Revamped the header files.
- Added the perl script mkpro, which automatically extracts prototypes from
  C source.
- Revamped Makefile.in, configure.in, etc.
- Revamped the README files and documentation.  They still suck tho :)
- Fixed a bug in slirp which would cause TCP/IP stacks with small receive
  windows (less than 8192) to lock up.  This was only really seen in Trumpet
  Winsock because Linux/FreeBSD/etc. usually have a default window size >=
  8192.
- Changed the copyright of ppp.c (with Juha's permission), so now there is
  no more GPL'd code in the slirp package.
- Updated portions of the TCP/IP code to FreeBSD 2.0.5.  Most of the changes
  in 2.0.5 relate to T/TCP and hash lookup of the TCP/UDP control blocks.
  These updates are not all that beneficial to slirp, so I won't incorporate
  them yet.
- Updated slirp's PPP code to use ppp-2.2b2.  This fixes some PPP bugs
  and also adds niceties like compression, etc. provided your PPP software
  supports it.
  Note: the compression code does not work yet.  It has been disabled by
  default, if you want to enable it, edit ppp/ppp-comp.h and change the
  #define of DO_BSD_COMPRESS to 1.  Be aware that code in bsd-comp.c is
  covered by patents in the states and other countries (not Australia), so
  don't enable it if this bothers you.
- Added link, tty, vj statistics.
- Changed all the "ptr += ..." stuff to use lprint().
- Fixed a problem with slirp not choosing an optimal send and receive buffer,
  which would result in slirp sending different sized packets.
- Fixed a bug in PPP which would sometimes bomb on uploads, thanks to Juha
  Pirkola.
- Added the ability to emulate any service on any port ("add emu").
- Added more commands: "show X", "unit", "stats tty", "stats alltty", "stats
  vj", "dns", "log stats", "log start", "socket", among others.
- Added 10.0.2.3 as an alias for your DNS (both UDP and TCP).  Only use this
  if slirp guesses the correct DNS at the start, or you give it a "dns"
  command.
- Made slirp chmod the tty device so that it will not receive talk/biff/etc.
  messages which would corrupt packets.
- Added Chris Metcalf's regular per-release patches *before* releasing it.
  Clever, eh? :)  Also thanks to Juha Pirkola for some pre-release bugfixes.
- Added a "quit" command and a prompt to slirp's command-line.
- Slirp's title has changed from "a (C)SLIP/PPP emulator" to the more
  descriptive "a TCP/IP emulator over the (C)SLIP/PPP link-level protocols".
  So there. :)
- "redir X" has changed.  You can now tell it which port to start looking
  for X redirections, and tell it to redirect to a specific X server.
- Made the DISPLAY variable be automatically set, provided you use
  slirp.telnetd-b.tar.gz (at usual slirp sites, in the "extra" directory).
  Note that if you don't use slirp.telnetd-b.tar.gz you will NOT get DISPLAY
  set automatically, period.  One thing you might try is set your LOCAL
  DISPLAY variable to the one suggested by slirp and let your telnet and the
  remote telnetd to negotiate the proper DISPLAY to set (if they both
  support it)
- Added a very extensive "help" command.  When you telnet to 10.0.2.0 and
  type "help" you get a list of commands guaranteed to be up-to-date, and
  typing "help COMMAND" will show it's usage and a brief description.  You
  can do this from the command-line too: -h COMMAND or "help [COMMAND]" and
  slirp will exit after showing you the help.
- Fixed PPP for systems without CID compression.  This will also help
  error-prone links.
- Added an option to ./configure, --disable-ppp, which will not compile in
  PPP.  Use this if you only use (C)SLIP, it'll make a much smaller
  executable.
- Added the following to the file COPYRIGHT:

If you find this software useful, please consider making a $10 (or more)
donation to your favorite charity organisation (GreenPeace, World Vision,
Salvation Army, etc).  If you make a donation above $20, I'll send you a
personally signed copy of slirp (well, PGP signed :).  I, and the lucky
charity organisation, thank you.

- *Lots* of minor, and *major* changes and improvements.  If you don't
  believe me, check the diff (it's about 700k) :)

Note that there are MANY changes in this version, so only use it if you're
prepared for horrible things that may go wrong.  You probably should stick
to 0.9o with the 2 patches mentioned in my WWW page applied.

Special thanks goes to Chris Metcalf for bashing slirp for the last week or
so and sending lots of clean-up patches and additions to make it more
"systems-and-compilers-I-don't-have-access-to" friendly (And for showing me
how silly C can really be :)

Version 0.9o (5/6/95)

- This is just another fix-for-the-sunos release.  It's not the first, and
  won't be the last.  Thanks to Juha Pirkola and Wilson Cheung
  (wcheung@netcom.com) for taking the time to look into this.  Thanks guys!
- Fixed X redirection.
- Fixed stats in a telnet session.
- Other (minor) misc fixes.

Version 0.9n (2/6/95)

- Added load-balancing support.  Now, people with 2 (or more) modems can
  effectively double (or more) their throughput.  Load-balancing support is
  NOT needed on your local machine, but it must be able to handle more than
  one SLIP/PPP interface (you cannot use vj compression). (not working yet)
- Completely overhauled the configuration of slirp.  It's much more flexible
  now.  Please read the file docs/CONFIG (not written yet) for details
  (NOTE: ~/.ppprc is not read anymore... you can "cat ~/.ppprc >>
  ~/.slirprc" to get it working again).
- Removed slirp.ftpd and slirp.telnetd from the main distribution.  You can
  get them separately from the usual slirp ftp sites.
- Fixed a stupid change I made to 0.9m which would severely slow the link
  down when 2 or more connections were sending data, and vj compression was
  used.  The change was actually done to make it a tiny bit faster... go
  figure :)
- Made some fixes to make sure packets are aligned on a 4 byte boundary,
  which should fix some crashes on some systems (I hope).
- Fixed the memmove problem (I hope).
- Many minor (and major) fixes.

(Many patches that were submitted to me were not included in this release
 because this was a rushed release (largely due to stupid bugs).  They'll
 make it in the next release, promise.  Note also that the MTU/MRU is pretty
 messy, and has now defaulted to 1500.  It too will be fixed in the next
 release.  For now, make sure you tell slirp both the new MTU and MRU and
 make sure they're the same)

Version 0.9m (22/5/95)

- Added slirp.ftpd.  This is similar to slirp.telnetd, but for ftp; that is,
  you can ftp 10.0.2.1 to ftp to the remote-host, there's no need to login,
  no syslog()'s will be done, other users can't see what you're ftping when
  they do a ps (unless you want them to), no getting refused a connection
  because there are too many people ftp logged in via ftp already, etc.
  (the original ftpd sources were taken from the FreeBSD-current)
- Fixed a bug in ppp_encap which would create lots of Incorrect Version
  Number errors, hence loss of packets, hence bad throughput.
- Fixed a bug in sl_compress_tcp which *might* fix the
  spontaneously-combusting connections. *crosses-fingers*
- Added more patches from Tom May <ftom@netcom.com> for slirp.telnetd.
- Added patches from Chris Metcalf which restarts a slirp session if the
  connection was broken.  To restart, run slirp with "-r".  You can have
  "-r" specified all the time so that scripts will automatically resume a
  lost connection, if one exists.  #define DO_RESTART in config.h if you
  want this capability.  It's really neat!  Thanks Chris! :)
  (Note that connections which use the address 10.0.2.1 will close after
  reconnection, since they are run under user privilege, real telnet/ftp
  connections shouldn't be affected though)
- Added more patches from Chris Metcalf to make PPP compile on more systems,
  and finally get rid of the evil -DANSI.
- Lots of minor fixes.

Version 0.9l (11/5/95)

- Added PPP support, thanks to Juha Pirkola <Juha.Pirkola@helsinki.fi>.  It
  isn't "fully" integrated into slirp yet (eg: you can only give PPP options
  on the command line), and there's a lot of fat-cutting to be done, but I
  have tested it and it works like a charm!  Thanks Juha! :)
  (Note that this version might not (won't) compile on all OS's, so if
  version 0.9k worked for you, stick with it until it becomes more
  integrated)
- More spelling corrections and patches to patch.solaris from Chris Metcalf.
- Reversed sunos.patch patches, and renamed the "new" sunos.patch to
  solaris.patch.alt, as an alternative to solaris.patch.  Use whichever
  works for you.
- Added emulation for DCC MOVE, thanks to Daniel J. O'Connor
  <doconnor@ist.flinders.edu.au>.

Version 0.9k (07/5/95)

- Added more 64bit fixes from Kai Makisara.  It should work on Alphas now.
- Added more patches from Chris Metcalf, including spelling fixes, krshd
  support, etc.
- Fixed X redirection from ~/.slirprc.
- Fixed some UDP redirection bugs, thanks to Jay Cotton
  <jay@calc.vet.uga.edu>.
- Hopefully fixed the zombie processes problem for good, thanks to William
  Greathouse.
- Fixed an MTU bug thanks to Jay Cotton <JAY@calc.vet.uga.edu>.  MTU's other
  than the default should work now.
- Renamed the file ALPHA!!! to ALPHA!!, since it looks like slirp might
  finally be stabilising :)
- Lots of other minor fixes.

Version 0.9j (02/5/95)

- IMPORTANT: The default special address has changed from 192.0.2.0 to
  10.0.2.0.  Read the file 00_README.NOW for details.
- Made some preliminary changes so it will work on 64-bit machines, thanks
  to Kai Makisara <makisara@abies.metla.fi>.  It probably won't work
  properly yet, but should in the next few releases.
- Fixed a bug that may solve the Trumpet Winsock Blues (or at least one
  verse), thanks to Juha Pirkola <Juha.Pirkola@helsinki.fi>.
- Added patches from William Greathouse to allow the PASV command to work on
  incoming ftp connections.
- Fixed X redirection from ~/.slirprc.
- Added patches from Chris Metcalf <metcalf@catfish.lcs.mit.edu> to be more
  K&R friendly, among other things.
- Lots of minor fixes.

Version 0.9i (19/04/95)

- Made ptyexec work in the command-line.
- Made "redir X" work in command-line and ~/.slirprc.
- Added support for PASV mode on incoming ftp connections.
- Argh! Had port 20 (ftp-data) same priority as telnet etc.  Should get
  better response times in telnet sessions now.
- Cleaned up the autoconfig a bit.
- Added better documentation of the commands in ~/.slirprc and the
  command-line.
- Made many changes so it compiles with no warnings when using the -Wall
  flags (well, 2 warnings, but they don't really exist :)
- Added more patches from William Greathouse.

Changes from SLiRP 0.9g -> 0.9h (16/04/95)

- Changed the exec/ptyexec commands so that an address may be specified too.
  (but the address must be of the form 10.0.2.xxx)
- Added strdup for the systems that don't have it.
- Fixed X redirection.  Now you must specify your home IP address.
- Added more stuff in TODO.  If you want to help, read this file and do one
  of the things listed.
- Added anti-idle mechanisms (must have at least one TCP connections active
  to have idle-prevention!)
- Added more ANSIfying.
- We have Autoconf!  *ALL* compiling troubles have now been solved, period.
  (yeah, right! :)
- Added do_wait() to eat defunct child processes, thanks to Joe Rumsey

- Lots of minor fixes/enhancements.

Changes from SLiRP 0.9f -> 0.9g (07/04/95)

- Fixed a strerror declaration.
- Hopefully (FINALLY!) fixed ftp.  If anyone sends me e-mail that ftp
  doesn't work, they'll be shot.
- Fixed the Makefile for SCO.
- Added README.NOW.  Please READ it... NOW! :)

Changes from SLiRP 0.9e -> 0.9f (06/04/95)

- Tried to fix ftp once more.
- Fixed some more embarrassing bugs.

Changes from SLiRP 0.9d -> 0.9e (05/04/95)

- I think I finally fixed the non-connecting problem, but it's ugly.  Thanks 
  to William Greathouse <wgg@netcom.com> who found it.  It still won't fix
  the fact that a connection attempt to a port with no process will 
  either hang or connect then disconnect.  (it works fine in Solaris, as
  usual)
- Made changes to tcp_timers so that Uni of Canberra users won't get 
  spontaneous resets of a connection, though it could help others too.
- Hopefully fixed ftp for some users.  Thanks to rossi@cs.unibo.it (Davide 
  Rossi) for pointing this out.
- Added patches by nlewis@is.net (Nate Lewis) to get slirp.telnetd to
  compile on SunOS.
- Added an extra check in main.c which shouldn't be needed (it should be
  taken care of by so_state) but crashes some systems. *sigh*

Changes from SLiRP 0.9c -> SLiRP 0.9d (04/04/95)

- *groan* SunOS still refuses to connect to non-localhosts.  Changed the
  connection-detection code again.
- Fixed a stoopid, stoopid mistake, which I won't tell you about, it's too
  embarrassing :)

Changes from SLiRP 0.9b -> SLiRP 0.9c (03/04/95)

- Changed the code to detect when a non-blocking connection failed.  Still
  trying to find the ideal combination that will work for all OSs.
- Ported to HPUX, bsdi.
- Removed the PORT_ANY code.  Now, if you don't care which port you get when
  redirecting, use port 0.

Changes from SLuRP 0.9a -> SLiRP 0.9b (30/03/95)

- Changed the name from SLuRP to SLiRP (slurp already exists)
- Added telnetd to the source tree, which, if compiled, will be used so that
  arbitrary commands can be executed by SLiRP (eg: by default, if you telnet
  to 10.0.2.1, you'll automatically get a shell instead of a login prompt)
- Completely removed the old way of "address encoding" to dynamically
  configure SLiRP, now you telnet to 10.0.2.0 and you get a "command-line"
  interface to configure SLiRP on-the-fly, as well as many other commands.
- Added the ability to execute a program on connection to a certain
  address/port.
- Changed if_output and if_start to be much smarter.  It's quite clever now :)
  No single session can hog the link, and if one interactive session gets
  greedy, it gets "downgraded" to the same priority as bulk data.
- Ported to SunOS, SCO, AIX.
- Way, way too many small changes to list... (I've forgotten them anyway)
