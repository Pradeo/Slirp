HOWLS!!!  Thank you for pulling this latest release of Slirp.

The new maintainer for Slirp is Kelly "STrRedWolf" Price
<tygris+slirp@erols.com>.  The homepage is now http://slirp.sourceforge.net

Now, this is a new release with new numbering similar to the Linux kernel,
so if you see a x.even.x release, it's a stable release, while x.odd.x is a
developmental release.

Do read the README.NEXT file located here fully.  I(Kelly) am getting alot of
bug reports that don't have alot of stuff to go on.  Also contained in that 
file is info on the mailing list.  Read it if you want to mess around with it,
there's alot to do inside!!!
