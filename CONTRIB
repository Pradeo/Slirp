This specific build is a merge of two separate SLiRP updates--

	Slirp 1.0c-KK
	=============

* Modified Feb 5 1998 by Karl Krueger <karl@simons-rock.edu>
*    with instructions from Philip C. Tsao

	Slirp 1.0g
	==========
* See changelog.  Numerous fixes.

The merging was done by me, Dan Kaminsky(effugas@best.com).

Any comments / fixes can be forwarded to either myself or Kelly
Price(tygris+slirp@erols.com).  Look for SLiRP on Freshmeat
(http://www.freshmeat.net).
