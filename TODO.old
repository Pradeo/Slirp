Long(er) term:

Add Predictor-1 compression

"r"-commands



Short term (BETA):

fix memmove... fix the NEED for memmove

give args to exec

make "exec" accept arguments

Update man page

Have all pending packets purged when a REXMIT is needed on a session?

Move comp_s to struct ttys? [not needed, since compression won't work on >1
ttys]

Have the last used ttyp at the head of the list? [cache?]

if the mtu changes, call msize_init()?

"add exec" for UDP

slirp.resolvd - emulate DNS packets

make debugging work BEFORE option parsing?

have m->m_data += if_maxlinkhdr in m_get()?

remove schedtime from pppdfcns.c

Change sosendto -> udp_sendto and soread -> tcp_read etc.
and do general cleaning up

warn for ports above 65535.

add "baudrate 0" [make FULL_BOLT == baudrate 0 ?]

have stats socket print udp[REDIRECT]
remove OOBINLINE

check all setsockopt/ioctl for opt=1

remove \n from ~/.slirprc

FIX FULL_BOLT

Fix sbreserve... there are STILL smaller packets being sent!

put "escape xx" in CFG_TELNET?

add identd emulation [half done]


make "towrite" an option

only update towrite when all modems are towrite < 0 ?

put ftp sites in documentation

if uid=0, bind priveladged port when source port is < 1024

add "add emu" crap to docs

asyncmap ffffffff
escape 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f
escape 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,1a,1b,1c,1d,1e,1f
